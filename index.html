<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Key Terms.</span></p>
<p>
  <span style="font-size: 10pt"
    >1. Cancellation on day of delivery is not possible as all items will have
    already began processing for delivery. Cancellation of any order must be
    done before the delivery day.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-size: 10pt"
    >2. In the event that you reject an order or you are not available to
    receive your order after it has been dispatched to you, an additional
    delivery fee will be charged for a second delivery and Afromart is not
    liable for natural deterioration of perishable items in such cases.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-size: 10pt"
    >3. While our utmost priority is to ensure our customers&amp;aspos;
    satisfaction, we acknowledge that there may be instances where items are not
    delivered in their entirety. This can occur due to delays on the part of our
    farmers and suppliers or issues related to the quality of specific items
    supplied. Nevertheless, please rest assured that we are fully committed to
    making every effort to provide you with complete orders whenever
    possible.</span

</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-size: 10pt"
    >4. Please be advised that our delivery partners adhere to a strict
    15-minute waiting window at designated locations. This policy is in place to
    ensure timely deliveries to all our valued customers, including those who
    may be awaiting their orders.</span

<p>
  <span style="font-size: 10pt"
